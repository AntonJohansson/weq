TODO

- Some weird stuff occurs when creating a texture with byte data and the size is 10*10,
  does not occur for 16*16 or 20*20 +
- FBOS
  - All FBOS are created with a depth component. More customizability please.
- Debug draw
  - Make more efficient (default meshes that you can scale)
- Texture for materials (refractive index)
- Edge shader (radiate properly)
- Wall texture
- Bunch of #undef near, far. Not sure where to place it :/
- Dynamically find resource path using exe location
- Read input from files
